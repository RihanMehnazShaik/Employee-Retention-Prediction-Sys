1. Server Setup
Framework: Flask
Functionalities:
Index Route (/): Renders index.html.
Training Route (/training): Handles POST requests to start model training.
Single Prediction Route (/prediction): Handles POST requests for single predictions.
Batch Prediction Route (/batchprediction): Handles POST requests for batch predictions.
Libraries and Modules: Flask, pandas, custom modules for training and prediction.
Middleware:
Flask Monitoring Dashboard: For monitoring.
CORS: Enabled for cross-origin requests.
Deployment: Runs on host 0.0.0.0 and port 5000.


2. Dependencies and Environment
Dependency Management: Listed in a requirements.txt file.
Virtual Environment: Recommended for dependency management to avoid conflicts.


3. Configuration Management
File Operations:
save_model: Saves models using pickle.
load_model: Loads models using pickle.
correct_model: Identifies the best model for a given cluster.


4. Logging
Integrated throughout the application for tracking events and errors.


5. Loading Training Dataset
Dataset: Contains employee records with features like empid, satisfaction_level, last_evaluation, etc.


6. Validating the Training Dataset
Process:
Logs the start and end of the data load, validation, and transformation process.
Archives old files.
Validates column length and missing values.
Creates and inserts data into a database table.
Exports validated data to a CSV file.
Moves processed files to a designated directory.
Exception handling for errors.


7. Preprocessing
Preprocessor Class:
get_data: Reads the dataset.
drop_columns: Drops specified columns.
is_null_present: Checks for missing values.
impute_missing_values: Imputes missing values using KNNImputer.
feature_encoding: Encodes categorical features using dummy encoding.
split_features_label: Splits dataset into features and labels.
preprocess_trainset: Orchestrates the entire preprocessing pipeline.


8. Clustering
KMeansCluster Class:
elbow_plot: Determines the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method.
create_clusters: Performs KMeans clustering and saves the trained model.


9. Model Tuning
ModelTuner Class:
best_params_randomforest: Finds the best parameters for Random Forest using grid search.
best_params_xgboost: Finds the best parameters for XGBoost using grid search.
get_best_model: Compares the performance of Random Forest and XGBoost, and selects the best model.


10. Training Process
TrainModel Class:
Logs the start of the training process.
Loads and validates data.
Performs preprocessing.
Creates clusters.
For each cluster, it splits data, tunes models, and saves the best model.


11. Prediction Process
Single and Batch Predictions:
Loads and validates the prediction dataset.
Preprocesses the data.
Generates predictions using the trained models.
Sends the prediction result back to the client.


12. File Operations
Ensures that models can be saved and loaded to avoid retraining on every restart.


13. User Interface
HTML Form: For inputting employee details.
Styling: Bootstrap for a clean and responsive design.
Form Handling: JavaScript and jQuery for capturing and sending data via AJAX.


14. Client-Side Scripting
JavaScript and jQuery:
Prevents default form submission.
Sends AJAX requests to the server.
Updates the UI with prediction results dynamically.
